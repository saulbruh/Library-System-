This is a data organizer for a fictitious library that I made for a finals project in my 1st semester of sophomore year in University. Its purpose is to be able to add, remove, modify status and assign values to other values in the system.

In this case, they are: books, employees, customers. The thigs you can do in the programs are change if a book is available to rent in the library, if the book is rented, what book is rented or available, who rented the book, when it was rented or returned, number of employees working.

There are things in the program that I haven't finished or are not working as intended and its not he most efficient and compact program in the world. I am planning on returning to this project in the future.
